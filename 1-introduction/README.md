## 1. What is Machine Learning
The term Machine Learning is one of the most popular and frequently used terms of today. For a machine learning beginner, the subject can sometimes feel overwhelming. Therefore, it is important to understand what machine learning actually is, and to learn about it step by step, through practical examples.

## 2. Terminology
Machine Learning (ML) is an important subset of artificial intelligence. ML is concerned with using specialized algorithms to uncover meaningful information and find hidden patterns from perceived data to corroborate the rational decision-making process.

## 3. Learning Content
This course will cover:
- Core concepts of Machine Learning
- Regression ML techniques
- Classification ML techniques
- Clustering ML techniques
- Natural Language Processing ML techniques
- Time series forecasting ML techniques
- Reinforcement Learning
- Real-world applications for ML

## 4. Examples of Applied ML
You can use Machine Learning in many ways:
- To predict the likelihood of disease from a patient's medical history or reports
- To leverage weather data to predict weather events
- To understand the sentiment of a text
- To detect fake news to stop the spread of propaganda
Finance, economics, earth science, space exploration, biomedical engineering, cognitive science, and even fields in the humanities have adapted machine learning to solve the data-processing heavy problems.

## 5. Conclusion
Machine Learning automates the process of pattern-discovery by finding meaningful insights from real-world or generated data. It has proven itself to be highly valuable in business, health, and financial applications, among others.
