## 1. Introduction
In this lesson, you will learn how to:
- Configure your computer for local machine learning tasks
- Work with Jupyter notebooks
- Use Scikit-learn, including installation
- Explore linear regression with hands-on exercise

## 2. Configurations
1. **Install Python.**
Ensure that Python is installed on the computer. You will use Python for many data science and machine learning tasks. 
2. **Install Visual Studio Code.**
Make sure you have Visual Studio Code installed on your computer. 
3. **Install Scikit-learn.**
Since you need to ensure that you use Python3, it's recommended that you use a virtual environment.
4. **Install Jupyter Notebook.**
You will need to install the Jupyter package.

## 3. Your Machine Learning Environment
You are going to use notebooks to develop your python code and create machine learning models. This type of file is a common tool for data scientists, and they can be identified by extension .ipynb.
Notebooks are an interactive environment that allow the developer to both code and add notes and write documentation around the code which is quite helpful for experimental or research-oriented projects.
