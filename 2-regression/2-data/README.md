# Build a Regression Model using Scikit-learn: prepare and visualize data

## 1. Introduction
As you work with data and apply ML solutions, it's very important to understand how to ask the right question to properly unlock the potentials of your dataset.
In this lesson, you will learn:
- How to prepare your data for model-building
- How to use Matplotlib for data visualization

## 2. Prepare Data
The questions you need to answer will determine what type of ML algorithms you will use. And the quality of the answer you get back will be heavily dependent on the nature of your data.

In fact, it is not very common to have a dataset that is completely ready to use to create ML model out of the box. In this lesson, you will learn how to prepare a raw dataset using standard Python libraries. You will also learn various techniques to visualize the data.

## 3. Visualize Data
Part of the data scientist's role is to demonstrate the quality and nature of the data they are working with. To do this, they often create interesting visualizations, or plots, graphs, and chars, showing different aspects of data.
In this way, they are able to visually show relationships and gaps that are otherwise hard to see.

Visualizations can also help determine the machine learning technique most appropriate for the data. A scatterplot that seems to follow a line, for example, indicates that the data is good candidate for a linear regression.
