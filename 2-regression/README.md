# Regression Models for Machine Learning

The lessons in this section cover types of regression in the context of machine learning. Regression models can help determine the relationship between variables. This type of model can predict values such as length, temperature, or age, thus uncovering relationships between variables as it analyzes data points.

In this series of lessons, you will discover the differences between linear and logistic regression.
